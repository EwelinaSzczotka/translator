<p>Haskell is a computer programming language. In particular, it is a '' <a href="Polymorphism" title="wikilink">polymorphically</a> <a href="typing" title="wikilink">statically typed</a>, <a href="Lazy_evaluation" title="wikilink">lazy</a>, <a href="functional_programming" title="wikilink">purely functional</a> '' language, quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named for <a href="Haskell_Brooks_Curry" title="wikilink">Haskell Brooks Curry</a>, whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the <em><a href="lambda_calculus" title="wikilink">lambda calculus</a></em>, hence the lambda we use as a logo.</p>
<h2 id="why_use_haskell">Why use Haskell?</h2>
<p>Writing large software systems that work is difficult and expensive. Maintaining those systems is even more difficult and expensive. Functional programming languages, such as Haskell, can make it easier and cheaper. For example, a new user who wrote a small relational DBMS in Haskell had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WOW! I basically wrote this without testing just thinking about my program in terms of transformations between types. I wrote the test/example code and had almost no implementation errors in the code! The compiler/type-system is really really good at preventing you from making coding mistakes! I've never in my life had a block of code this big work on the first try. I am WAY impressed.</p>

<p>Even if you are not in a position to use Haskell in your programming projects, learning Haskell can make you a better programmer in any language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned Haskell a couple of years ago, having previously programmed in Python and (many) other languages. Recently, I've been using Python for a project (the choice being determined by both technical and non-technical issues), and find my Python programming style is now heavily influenced (for the better, I hope ;-) by my Haskell programming experience.<br />
